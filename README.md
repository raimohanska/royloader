## Royloader.js

Adds support for `<script language="roy">`.

Requires [Roy](http://roy.brianmckenna.org/), jQuery.

See example usage in [index.html](https://github.com/raimohanska/royloader/blob/master/index.html).

*Disclaimer*: this is in "early alpha" or more like on the "I've tried this once with the alert('lol') example" stage

### TODO

- gather experience on how this works in practise
- find out how other similar loaders actually work and do the same (if good)
- add to bower (roy's not there either yet)
- maybe contribute this to the roy core (when the loader code is more solid)
- print t-shirts (sell for profit)
